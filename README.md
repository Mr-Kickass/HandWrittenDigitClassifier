# HandWrittenDigitClassifier
Build NN using Keras for classification

1.Read data from location https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
2.Create trainSet and testSet
3.Use Keras to build layers for modelling NN
4.Normalize feature set
5.Convert output labels into one hot vectors
6.Compile model over 20 epochs in batches of 10 using adam optimizer
7.Accuracy observed is 97.98%
8.Generate predicted results
